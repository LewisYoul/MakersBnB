  <p>
  Hello! You are now visiting somewhat of an airbnb <br>
  prototype done by four funny and crazy start up
  <br> coders! We say crazy as we've done all of this
  within <br> six weeks! You've probably clone this repo
  as you <br> are seeing this now but to find out more about
  us,<br> check us out on our githubs. We hope you have <br>
  fun booking a property to rent with us.
