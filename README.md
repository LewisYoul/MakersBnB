## <a name="task">Task</a>

This week was our first opportunity since beginning Makers Academy to create a project as part of a group. We were tasked with implementing our own version of the popular travel site AirBnB. This brought with it a number of new challenges that we were excited to explore!


User stories:

```
As a user,
When I'm looking on this MakersBNB,
I would like to view rentals on the home page

As a user,
When I'm looking on this MakersBNB,
I would like to search properties by city

As a user,
When I'm looking on this MakersBNB,
I would like to see the property overview that I've selected

```
We started off with listing all the AIRBNB user stories that could possibly exist from researching the workflow of how a User engages with AIRBNB. After that, we narrowed it down to three and chose the three user stories that would make our website unique

Other Accomplished User Stories:
====================

```
-User can sign in to the website
-User can log in to the website
-User can log out from the website
-User canâ€™t use the same username that has been installed
-User has to make sure the passwords are the same.
-User can search by city
-User can search by date
-When search, the list automatically reduces
-User can check out individual booking (Page)
-User can see the image of place, the availability, the guests, the price on the individual page
-User can book and receives a confirmation page
-User can go back to the home page after confirmation
-User gets to enjoy a nice interface during the experience
```

In order to run MakersBnB locally and execute tests it requires that the postgreSQL databases are set up on your machine. To do this follow the steps below:

* Clone this repo
* Change into the required directory and run `bundle install`.
* Now do the following (note - you may need to set up your psql beforehand):

```


```

 You can then run `rackup` to start the local server and Following this navigate to your browser of choice and enter your the port on which you are hosting. If this doesn't work you may need to run `rake db:auto_migrate` in the terminal to generate your User and Post tables.
